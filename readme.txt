Assignment Description:

Scope

You are going to develop a system that satisfies your problem domain and architecture from Assignment 2.
This system must support the requirements and features you identified in assignment 2.
You may change the architecture if needed, but also make sure you site the reasons and source for the architecture.



Using your selected architecture and requirements artifacts as guides:
Design your solution using established design techniques in class
Cite the techniques and patterns used to perform your design
Begin coding your application using the design youâ€™ve created to guide your implementation
What should be turned in:
A textual and diagram description of your design, citing your design techniques, you MUST map to establish design techniques covered in class or cite your sources of design.
Code for your application, link in git, or a package of your code I can open and view.



HOW TO RUN THE CODE
I'm using flask to test the connectivity of my pages, but im sure you can just look at the html in browser.

//Referenced from my classmates' documentation for our main class project, DnDEZ
Dependencies
 - linux command line
 - python3.8 or greater

How to run:
    Navigate to /CPSC-362-Assignment-3/assignment3env
    Command line type: source bin/activate
    navigate to /assign3/backend/
    make sure everything in reqiurements.txt is installed
    command line type: python3 main.py

You should now be able to access the app on http://localhost:5000

This is the way I've managed to get it to run on my system, professor if my documentation is unclear, please let me know.
